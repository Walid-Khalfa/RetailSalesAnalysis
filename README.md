# Online Retail Sales Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on transactional data from an online retail store. The project aims to uncover key sales trends, customer behavior insights, and identify top-selling products and countries to make data-driven business decisions.

## Project Overview

Using Python and libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the dataset was analyzed and visualized to uncover key trends. The insights obtained can drive strategic business decisions and improve store performance.

### Key Findings

- **Sales Trends**: Identified peak sales periods (e.g., holiday season) and busiest days of the week.
- **Top-Selling Products**: Highlighted best-selling products to optimize inventory.
- **Geographical Distribution**: Analyzed sales distribution by country to inform targeted marketing efforts.

### Recommendations

1. Implement seasonal promotions during peak sales months.
2. Optimize inventory levels for top-selling products.
3. Focus marketing efforts on countries with high sales volumes.
